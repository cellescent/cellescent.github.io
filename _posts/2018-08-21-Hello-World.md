I am putting a post in here and it'll have a name that isn't dated like four years ago!

# Markdown Big
## Markdown Medium
### Markdown Small
**BOLD** *italic* _also italic_ normal text

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
